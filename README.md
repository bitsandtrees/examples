# Bits and Trees Examples

Hi!  Here you can find all of the examples for the lessons on [Bits and Trees](http://bitsandtrees.com).

## Structure
They are organized by `./<course>/<lesson>/<language>`.  So for example, if you'd like to access the 
examples for the [Set](https://www.bitsandtrees.com/courses/data-structure-fundamentals/screencasts/5)
can be found at `./data-structure-fundamentals/05-set/js/`.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute your favorite language to the examples in one of the lessons, please fork
this repo, add a directory under the lesson with the name of your language (ex. `python`, `cpp`, `haskell`),
create the example, and ensure you add tests that are comparable to the initial language.  Please include
a README.md under your language directory with instructions on how to start the example and run the tests.
